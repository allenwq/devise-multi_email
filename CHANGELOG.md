* Deprecate the support of Rails 4 (although it might still work)
* Fix warnings in Rails 6

### 2.0.1 - 2017-05-16

* Refactored to simplify some logic and start moving toward mimicking default Devise lifecycle behavior
* Added `Devise::MultiEmail.only_login_with_primary_email` option to restrict login to only primary emails
* Added `Devise::MultiEmail.autosave_emails` option to automatically enable `autosave` on "emails" association

### 2.0.0 - 2017-05-12

* New `Devise::MultiEmail#configure` setup with options for `user` and `emails` associations and `primary_email_record` method names
* Refactor to expose `_multi_email_*` prefixed methods on models
* Changed logic when changing an email address to look up existing email record, otherwise creating a new one, then marking it "primary"
* Changed logic when changing an email address to mark all others as `primary = false`
* Changed logic when changing an email address to `nil` to mark as `primary = false` rather than deleting records
