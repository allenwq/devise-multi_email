* Integrates `unconfirmed_email` into `emails` collection

### 2.0.1 - 2017-05-16

* Added `Devise::MultiEmail.only_login_with_primary_email` option to restrict login to only primary emails
* Added `Devise::MultiEmail.configure_autosave` option to automatically enable `autosave` on `emails` association, to ensure email changes are persisted from parent record

* New `Devise::MultiEmail#configure` setup with options for `user` and `emails` associations and `primary_email_record` method names

* Changed logic when changing an email address to look up existing email record, otherwise creating a new one, then marking it "primary"
* Changed logic when changing an email address to mark all others as `primary = false`
* Changed logic when changing an email address to `nil` to mark as `primary = false` rather than deleting records
